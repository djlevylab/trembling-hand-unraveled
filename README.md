# The trembling hand unraveled: the motor dynamics and neural sources of choice inconsistency
This is the code package for the manuscript “The trembling hand unraveled: the motor dynamics and neural sources of choice inconsistency” by Vered Kurtz-David, Asaf Madar, Adam Hakim, Noa Palmon & Dino J Levy.
<br>The manuscript presents the results from three studies (behavioral, MRI and replication studies). Only the behavioral study codes are currently shared in the repository. 
## System requirements
The code was run and tested on MATLAB 2020b, 2021b and 2022b editions on Windows 11.
Cluster correction code for fMRI requires bvbabel (BrainVoyager's Python package). Installation from https://github.com/ofgulban/bvbabel 
## Installation guide
Install MATLAB 2022b edition. 
<br>Install the Deep Learning Toolbox and the Symbolic Math Toolbox.
## Demo
To extract the mouse features from mouse tracking data, run the script located at extract_mouse_features\main.m using MATLAB’s interface.
- Input: see directories extract_mouse_features\data\Main task\Trial_level_data_and_parameters, extract_mouse_features\data\Main task\Mouse_tracking
Each subject has 6 xls files, which contain their trial level mouse tracking data, and trial level inconsistency data, for all three tasks: main task, motor task and numerical task (3 tasks * 2 files per task).
- Output: AllResults-Main task.mat, AllResults-Motor_localizer.mat, AllResults-Numerical_localizer.mat. These are mouse features structs stored in three files corresponding to the three tasks used in the manuscript, and are required for the next sections.
<br><br>Runtime: 35-40 minutes.
### Inconsistency indices
To generate the inconsistency indices download the code package provided by Halevey et al. (2018) from https://github.com/persitzd/RP-Toolkit 
<br>The output of the trial-level inconsistency indices is located in extract_mouse_features\data\Main task\Trial_level_data_and_parameters.
<br>The output of the subject-level inconsistency indices is located in figures_analyses\fig2\ subject_level_inconsistency_indices.xls
<br>The raw data for subjects’ choices is in directory raw_data_for_inconsistency_indices. All raw data files have the following structure:
1) Column A - subject ID
2) Column B - trial number
3) Column C - choice X-axis
4) Column D - choice Y-axis
5) Column E - max. X-axis (intersection of the budget line with the X-axis)
6) Column F - max. Y-axis (intersection of the budget line with the Y-axis)
7) Coulumn E+F provide the budget line parameters

### Figure 2
1) For plotting subjects’ inconsistency indices, run the code in directory fig2: Fig2a_plottingInconsistencyIndices.m.
Input: The code uses the subject-level inconsistency indices (output from the Halevy et al. code package) for all three studies. 
(*) This code also outputs Supplementary Fig. 7.
2) For plotting the share of total expenditure that subjects allocated to the Y-axis as a function of the budget line’s slope, run Fig2b_PlottingSubjectsChoicesLogPrices_aggregateAllSubs.m. 
Input: The code uses subjects’ choices raw data from all three studies.
3) For plotting the distributions of Euclidean Distances from targets in the non-value tasks, run Fig2c_EucDist_distributions.m
Input: The code uses as input the design matrices from the cross-tasks regressions. See Figures 4 & 5 below for details about generating those matrices (for the Behavioral study). 
### Figure 3
For plotting subjects’ mouse features distributions run the code in directory fig3: Fig3e_features_dist_across_trials_and_subjects_BehavioralStudy.m. 
- Input: AllResults-Main task.mat (output of extract_mouse_features\main.m)
### Figure 4 & 5
For regression analyses, run the following codes:
1) Create regression design matrices for each task (which also z-score features values), using: writeDesignMatrix_MainTask_BehavioralStudy.m, writeDesignMatrix_MotorTask_BehavioralStudy.m, writeDesignMatrix_NumericalTask_BehavioralStudy.m
- Inputs: AllResults-Main task.mat, AllResults-Motor_localizer.mat, AllResults-Numerical_localizer.mat
- Output: DesignMatrix_ZScoredAcrossSubject_MotorTask_BehavioralStudy.xls, DesignMatrix_ZScoredAcrossSubject_NumericalTask_BehavioralStudy.xls, DesignMatrix_ZScoredAcrossSubjectWithNans_MainTaskBehavioralStudy.xls
2) Combine those design matrices into one design matrix for all the cross-tasks regressions, using create_trial_by_trial_matrix.m
- Output: DesignMatrix_AcrossTasks_BehavioralStudy.xls
3) Run regressions that only include the main task, using Regressions_onlyMainTask_SelectedFeatures_BehavioralStudy.m
- Input: DesignMatrix_ZScoredAcrossSubjectWithNans_MainTaskBehavioralStudy.xls
- Apart from the regression tables, this code also output Fig. 4e (Behavioral study) and Supplementary Fig. 9.
4) Run the cross-tasks regressions, using Regressions_AllTasksCombined_SelectedFeatures_BehavioralStudy.m
- Input: DesignMatrix_AcrossTasks_BehavioralStudy.xls
- Apart from the regression tables, this code also output Fig. 4d (Behavioral study) and Fig. 5b.
